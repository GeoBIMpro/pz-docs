Piazza is a set of open source, cloud-based services aimed at helping developers build
GEOINT applications and services. Piazza provides features like data load and access, workflow
execution, and execution of user-provided services deployed elsewhere on the web -- features that developers
could build themselves, but often shouldn't have to.

Piazza is part of the Venice Project, an open source community focused on building cloud-based frameworks,
tools, applications, and other initiatives in support of Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) needs.
