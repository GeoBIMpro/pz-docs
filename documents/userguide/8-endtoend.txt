# End-to-End Example

In this section, a workflow will be described to make use of pzsvc-file-watcher, pzsvc-preview-generator
and other Piazza components to automatically crop files uploaded to a given s3 bucket.


## Setting up pzsvc-file-watcher

The pzsvc-file-watcher automatically watches for uploaded files to the s3 bucket and ingests them to the
Piazza service.

To begin, clone the pzsvc-file-watcher from https://github.com/venicegeo/pzsvc-file-watcher:

`git clone https://github.com/venicegeo/pzsvc-file-watcher`

Next, install pzsvc-file-watcher's dependencies:

`pip2 install -r requirements.txt`

pzsvc-file-watcher takes a few command line arguments, including the s3 bucket location, the user's
AWS access key and private key, and the user's Piazza UserName and Gateway host name. AWS
credentials are checked for in the `s3.key.access` and `s3.key.private` environment variables, and
can also be supplied via command line. Additionally, the s3 bucket name can be specified in the
`s3.bucket.name` environment variable, and the `PZUSER` environment variable is checked for the
value of the user's Piazza UserName. In addition, the Piazza Gateway Host should be specified.

An example of running filewatcher.py via the command line:

`python2 filewatcher.py -b 'aws_bucket_name' -g 'https://pz-gateway.DOMAIN' -a 'aws_access_key' -p 'aws_private_key' -u 'piazza_username'`

This will set up the pzsvc-file-watcher to poll continuously for new files in the `aws_bucket_name`
bucket, and ingest those files (without hosting them!) to the Piazza service.

The output of running the filewatcher will look something like the following:

`Listening for new files. This will continuously poll until the         process is terminated.`
`Successful request for ingest of file 0272f68b-b979-4f5f-95d0-1e2d0f96133a-elevation.tif of type raster`

This response means that the ingest request was received by the Piazza Gateway.


## Registering the pzsvc-preview-generator service

The purpose of https://github.com/venicegeo/pzsvc-preview-generator[pzsvc-preview-generator] is to
showcase Piazza's core capabilities. This app exposes a REST endpoint which takes a POST request
containing payload of required parameters. Given an s3 location, it downloads a raster file, crops
the image, uploads the cropped raster back up to s3 bucket, and returns a DataResource.

POST a request with a payload to the URL: https://pz-svcs-prevgen.venicegeo.io/crop

Sample working payload:

[source,json]
----
{
    "source": {
        "domain": "s3.amazonaws.com",
        "bucketName": "pz-svcs-prevgen",
        "fileName": "NASA-GDEM-10km-colorized.tif"
    },
    "function": "crop",
    "bounds": {
        "minx": -140.00,
        "miny": 10.00,
        "maxx": -60.00,
        "maxy": 70.00
    }
}
----

Service will download the file from "pz-svcs-prevgen" s3 bucket and crop it with given bounding box
info. The cropped result tif will be uploaded back up to s3 bucket "pz-svcs-prevgen-output":
https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1#&bucket=pz-svcs-prevgen-output&prefix=

If all goes well, the resulting received payload will be of DataResource type:

[source,json]
----
{
    "dataType": {
        "type": "raster",
        "location": {
            "type": "s3",
            "bucketName": "pz-svcs-prevgen",
            "fileName": "478788dc-ac85-4a85-a75c-cbb352620667-NASA-GDEM-10km-colorized.tif",
            "domainName": "s3.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "mimeType": "image/tiff"
    },
    "metadata": {
        "name": "External Crop Raster Service",
        "id": "478788dc-ac85-4a85-a75c-cbb352620667-NASA-GDEM-10km-colorized.tif",
        "description": "Service that takes payload containing s3 location and bounding box for some raster file, downloads, crops and uploads the crop back up to s3.",
        "url": "http://host:8086/crop",
        "method": "POST"
    }
}
