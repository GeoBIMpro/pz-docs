# Additional Notes and FAQs

## Pagination

HTTP requests that return arrays of objects typically support these query parameters for pagination:

* `?page=INT`
* `?perPage=INT`
* `?sortBy=STRING`
* `?order=STRING` - must be either `asc` or `desc`

For example, together these two calls will return the sixty most recent log messages, thirty at a time, sorted by creation date:

    GET /messages?perPage=30&page=0&key=createdOn&order=asc
    GET /messages?perPage=30&page=1&key=createdOn&order=asc


## HTTP Status Codes

Piazza typically only uses these HTTP status codes:

`200 OK`::
The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request. For `GET`, the response is an entity containing the requested resource. For `POST`, it is entity containing the result of the action.

`201 Created`::
The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in the entity of the response. The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code.

`400 Bad Request`::
The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.

`401 Unauthorized`::
The request requires user authentication, e.g., due to missing or invalid authentication token.

`403 Forbidden`::
The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help. May be used in cases where user is not authorized to perform the operation or the resource is unavailable for some reason (e.g., time constraints, etc.).

`404 Not Found`::
The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

`500 Internal Server Error`::
The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.


## Structure of returned objects

JSON objects returned by Piazza follow this form:

    {
        "type": "...",
        "data": {
            ....
        }
    }

The `type` field is used to indicate the contents of the `data` field.
