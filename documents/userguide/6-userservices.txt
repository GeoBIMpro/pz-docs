# User Services

Piazza can invoke external services, such as orthorectifying an image or running a statistical
analysis on a feature set.

NOTE: Piazza currently requires you have the user service instance deployed at a public URL. In
the future, the user service will be a deployable container, so Piazza can scale up and down the
number of instances needed.

## Registration

*TODO*

A user service must be _registered_ with Piazza before it can be executed. In the registration operation,
the client sends to Piazza a JSON
payload with the URL of the service, a description of its parameters, and other metadata.
