# Piazza Core Overview

The core functionality of Piazza is split up into several internal components that are shown in the below diagram.

Piazza consists of a set of stateless microservices where core capabilities are broken up into small independent deployable services.  Stateless microservices treat each request as an independent transaction and do not rely on previous data or “state” from previous requests.  The Gateway takes the incoming Piazza requests and routes them to the appropriate services. Figure 2 shows an overview of Piazza’s microservices and how they interact with each other.  

Communication between these microservices is done using two mechanisms.  The primary mechanism is using HTTPS where microservices communicate directly by initiating requests and receiving responses.   The second mechanism is using asynchronous notifications where communication is initiated when specific conditions are met.  The second mechanism leverages Apache Kafka message bus and Elasticsearch Triggers to provide for asynchronous notifications.
