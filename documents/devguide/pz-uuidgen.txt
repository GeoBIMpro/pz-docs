# UUID Generator

## Description

The UUID Generator provides a system-wide, common way to generate IDs for various object in the system. It can be used to generate up to 255 UUIDs at a time.

UUIDs are represented as strings, as per [[RFC 4122|https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt]].

## Command Line App

The service is started as a command line app:

    $ pz-uuidgen [-local]

In local mode, the logger runs on `localhost:12341`.

If `debug` is specified, the service will generate fake UUID strings in the sequence "0", "1", "2", ...

## HTTP API

### `GET /`

Requests a "health check" for the service.

The returned status code is `200` and a body with a short, friendly text string.

### `POST /v1/uuids?count=$n`

Requests `$n` UUIDs from the service.

The optional `count` parameter specifies the number of UUIDs to generate. `$n` must be >= 0 and <= 255. If `count` is omitted, `$n` is assumed to be 1.

The returned value is a JSON object containing an array of UUIDs (as strings):

    { "data": ["xxxx", "yyyy", ...] }

Note that if `$n` is zero, the result will be `{ "data": [] }`
