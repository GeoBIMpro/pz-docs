# UUID Generator

The UUID Generator provides a system-wide, common way to generate IDs for various object in the system. It can be used to generate up to 255 UUIDs at a time.

UUIDs are represented as strings, as per https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt[RFC 4122].

## Command Line App

The service is started as a command line app:

    $ pz-uuidgen

## HTTP API

### `POST /uuids?count=$n`

Requests `$n` UUIDs from the service.

The optional `count` parameter specifies the number of UUIDs to generate. `$n` must be >= 0 and <= 255. If `count` is omitted, `$n` is assumed to be 1.

The returned value is a JSON object containing an array of UUIDs (as strings):

[source,json]

    "statusCode": 201,
    "type": "string-list",
    "data": [
        "0507b093-1e12-4ffc-8a12-b705610a8336"
    ]
}

Note that if `$n` is zero, the result will be `{ "data": [] }`

Pagination is not supported.
