## HTTP Conventions

These are our favorite HTTP codes. Contributions welcome!

_Taken from the top ten in http://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html (except mpg added 201 and removed 304)._


**200 OK**

The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request, for example:
* GET: an entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in the response
* POST: an entity describing or containing the result of the action


**201 Created**

The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created. The newly created resource can be referenced by the URI(s) returned in the entity of the response.

The origin server MUST create the resource before returning the 201 status code. If the action cannot be carried out immediately, the server SHOULD respond with 202 (Accepted) response instead.


**202 Accepted**

The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.


**204 No Content**

The server successfully processed the request but is not returning any content, e.g. from a successful DELETE.

The 204 response MUST NOT include a message-body.


**400 Bad Request**

The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.


**401 Unauthorized**

The request requires user authentication, e.g. due to missing or invalid authentication token.


**403 Forbidden**

The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help.

May be used in cases where user is not authorized to perform the operation or the resource is unavailable for some reason (e.g. time constraints, etc.).


**404 Not Found**

The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.


**409 Conflict**

The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource, e.g. due to incompatible versions in a PUT.

This code is only allowed in situations where it is expected that the user might be able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request. The response body SHOULD include enough information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict.


**500 Internal Server Error**

The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
