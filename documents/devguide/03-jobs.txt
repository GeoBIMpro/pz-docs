## Accessing Piazza 

Using Piazza, NPEs can perform actions such as the loading and retrieval data, the registration and execution user services, and registration of workflow events or triggers. The requests and responses from the Gateway are defined via JSON. The Gateway acts as an external broker, or proxy, to the internal components of the Piazza application. The Gateway will receive user requests, and then route that request or command to the appropriate internal Piazza component. 

The Gateway is the single point-of-contact for external users to interact with Piazza Core components. This API provides functionality for loading and accessing data, registering and executing services, and registering events and triggers. The entirety of Piazza functionality is accessed through these Gateway API calls.

For details on the Gateway API, see https://pz-swagger.geointservices.io/[Swagger Documentation] for details on each of the endpoints.

For details on how to use case scenarios, see the https://pz-docs.geointservices.io/userguide/index.html[Piazza Users Guide].

For details on the code for the Gateway, see the <<Gateway>> section for details.
