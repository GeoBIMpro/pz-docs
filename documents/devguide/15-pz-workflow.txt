# Workflow Service

## Overview
The pz-workflow service enables the construction and use of "event" notifications to enable simple "if-this-happens-then-do-that" workflows. This is done though an HTTP API. For a walkthough visit the Users Guide, for a simple overview visit `https://pz-swagger.geointservices.io/#/Workflow`.

A user will follow these general steps:

. Register a new event type
. Register a trigger for that event type
. Send an event
. Poll for new alerts
. Go to 3.

## Running Locally
