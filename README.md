# pz-docs

This is the content )and builder) for the Piazza documentation in both HTML and PDF.

AsciiDoctor is the new AsciiDoc. Donâ€™t get confused!

## Conventions for doc writers

Linking:
- For hyperlinks within the pz-docs system, always use relative links. Do not include "spaces" or domain names.
- For links within "our" deployment domains, e.g. to `pz-swagger`, use `venicegeo.io` (the `prod` deployment).
